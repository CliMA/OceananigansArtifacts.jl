# Idealized LESbrary data

The data in this directory tree was generated by idealized large eddy simulations of ocean surface boundary layers.

## Data organization

The data is organized by the duration of the simulation:

* the `two_day_suite` were run for two physical days,
* the `four_day_suite` were run for four physical days,

et cetera.

Within each suite there are data for multiple resolutions:

* `4m_resolution` are data for simulations with 4 meter horizontal resolution,
* `2m_resolution` are data for simulations with 2 meter horizontal resolution.

The grid is stretched in the vertical, generally ranging from approximately 1/4 the horizontal
resolution at the surface to equal to the horizontal resolution at the bottom.

For each resolution there are six cases ranging from pure convection to pure wind forcing,
all with a Coriolis parameter `f = 1e-4 1/s`.
There is one non-rotating case with wind forcing called `strong_wind_no_rotation` with `f=0`.

## Data generation

The data here was generated with snippets like

```julia
using Oceananigans
using LESbrary
using LESbrary.IdealizedExperiments: two_day_suite_parameters

parameters = two_day_suite_parameters[:free_convection]

configuration = (;
    architecture = GPU(),
    size = (64, 64, 64),
    snapshot_time_interval = 1minute,
    passive_tracers = true,
    time_averaged_statistics = false,
    stokes_drift = true,
    stokes_drift_peak_wavenumber = 2π / 300) # m⁻¹

simulation = three_layer_constant_fluxes_simulation(; configuration..., parameters...)

run!(simulation)
```
